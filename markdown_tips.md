### Markdown Tips
(all of these tips work in Google Docs as well!)<br>
For all tips use [this link](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

To view your Markdown in  Visual Studio Code as it will be rendered in the browser click the 'open preview' button in the top right of the text editor
## Headers
Use hashtags to designate headers. One hashtag is the biggest header, three hashtags is the third biggest header.

## Links
### inline link:
wrap the link in square brackets and then the link in standard brackets [] then ()
[this is the inline link](this is the url)

## Images
Images work the same as links but with an exclamation mark at the start. The content in the square brackets will become the alt text
e.g. ![alt text](link to image)

## Lists
### Bullet pointed list
Use asterisks (*) to designate lists
e.g.
*item one
*item two

### Numbered List
Just write the list like:
1. item one
2. item two
No need for any special characters!

### Indented Lists
Just use a tab key to indent the list. Just like on Word or Google Docs
*item one
    *nested item one


## Code
### one line of code
``Wrap your code in a backtick: `code` ``
e.g. `python code.py`

### code block
Nest your code within three backticks (`) <br>
e.g.
```
code line 1 
code line 2
```

### Line Breaks
use <br> for line breaks
