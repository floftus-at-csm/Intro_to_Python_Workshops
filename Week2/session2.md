Notes
* The dollar sign just indicates that this is a command that *runs in the terminal* rather than in a script.
* Every new command is designated with a space. So don't put spaces in your folder or file names!



Some programs only do one function and so you miss out the process step
e.g.
```
cd this_directory
```
These are generally in built commands like 
``` 
pwd
ls
cd <folder_name>
touch <file_name>
nano <file_name>
```
