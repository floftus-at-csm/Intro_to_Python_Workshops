# Week 3 Tasks
### 1. Recap Part A
* can you create a script that 
    * asks the user for their favourite year for music (remember you'll have to put their input into a variable)
    * converts this date from a string to an int 
    * checks if this year is in the 90s, 00s, 10s, 20s,
    * tells the user they are a "90s kid" or a "00s kid" (or whatever you would like to say here) if their date is in the 90s
    * tells them that you don't consider dates further back than the 90s if the year is in the 80s

### 2. Recap Part B
* install yt-dlp with the command ``` pip install yt-dlp``` or ```pip3 install yt-dlp```
* check that the install is succesful by creating a new script called  ```youtube_downloader.py``` and adding the content ```from yt_dlp import YoutubeDL```
* run this script and check for errors

### 3. Getting all files from a directory
* create an ```input``` folder within week 3 and within that folder create an ```images``` folder
* add a set of images to this folder
* use one of the methods from 'session3.md' to get all the image paths from this folder into an array. You'll need to set your path from where you are running the code from. E.g. if I run the code from ```Intro_To_Python_Workshops``` I'll need to include ```/Week3``` in my path.
* see if you can access one of the file paths in the array and can print it to the console
* see if you can use the file path to show the image
