## recap

## Data Structures
### Arrays
Lists and arrays are one of the core data structures in python. For now, lets see them as interchangeable terms.
Lists allow you to group data together. 
We declare an empty list like
```
my_list = []
```
or a list with content like
```
my_list = ["youtube_url", "youtube_url2"]
```
or an empty list of a specific size
```
my_empty_list = [None] * 10
```


* arrays/lists
    * creating them
    * accesing values
    * deletings values
* get file paths in folder into l

## loops
